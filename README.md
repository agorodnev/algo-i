Solutions for homework assignments on Coursera Algorithms part I.

Course homepage: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1.
This set of solutions allowed me to earn a final grade - 95%.

Problem | Grade
------------ | -------------
Union-Find | 93%
Stacks and Queues | 100%
Mergesort | 98%
Priority Queues | 100%
Geometric Applications of BSTs | 80%

The last problem has ugly solution and it could be more correct, 
but it passes the grading system threshold gaining 80%. Probably I will fix
bugs there and update this solution with more accurate one.
